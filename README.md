This project contains my final project for bachelor's degree, the topic is about Nuclei Segmentation and Classification to Identify Cells in Micro Environment 
of Tumor using Fully Convolutional Network Deep Learning.

-Tools- 
    Jupyter Notebook

-Language- 
    Python

-Background- 
    The tumor microenvironment is an ecosystem consisting of the spatial organization of various types of cells in and around the tumor that can interfere
with health because it takes the body's nutritional intake for tumor development. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate and identify cells in the tumor
microenvironment so that prevention or early treatment can be carried out in patients. This report presents the design of nuclei segmentation and classification
in multi-organ using Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) Deep Learning using the Multi-Organ Nuclei Segmentation and Classification Challenge:2020
(MoNuSAC:2020) dataset to identify the tumor microenvironment in four cell categories, namely epithelial, lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. The
FCN architecture tested was pure U-Net with different starting point filters, namely 16, 32, and 64 and U-net by changing the encoder section to another architecture,
namely ResNet34, ResNet50, VGG16, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB3. Based on observations, segmentation and classicization of the nucleus in
multiple organs were successfully implemented using FCN Deep Learning by getting the best IoU value of 0.8479 using pure U-Net architecture with a starting
point of 64 filters and the best PQ value of 0.8000 using ResNet34 U-Net architecture

-Notes- 
    Hi, I doing this project in August 2021 - February 2022. I really enjoyed my experience with image dataset and hopefully you will get something from here.
